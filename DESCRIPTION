Description: Calculates grey level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) based texture measures (Hall-Beyer (2017) <https://prism.ucalgary.ca/bitstream/handle/1880/51900/texture%20tutorial%20v%203_0%20180206.pdf>; Haralick et al. (1973) <doi:10.1109/TSMC.1973.4309314>) of raster layers using a sliding rectangular window. It also includes functions to quantize a raster into grey levels as well as tabulate a glcm and calculate glcm texture metrics for a matrix.
